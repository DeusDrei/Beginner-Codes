            <p>Wakana is quite tall for his age, standing at at least 180 centimeters. 
                <br>(When Marin asked him his height, he was interrupted before he could finish saying, meaning he's likely taller than 180cm.) 
                <br>He has short, black hair and grey eyes, along with a tiny mole on the outer lower corner of his right eye.
                <br>Outside of his school uniform, he is always wearing a samue, 
                <br>a general work outfit consisting of a blue suit jacket and pants, with a simple white shirt underneath. 
                <br>He wears wooden sandals and also tends to wear a white headband while working. 
                <br>When not wearing his headband, he tends to have it over his shoulders.
                <br><br><br>
                Wakana's main goal in life is to become a hina doll craftsman (a kashira-shi - 頭師) like his grandfather. 
                <br>He is very knowledgeable and loving towards the dolls his grandfather’s store makes and sells. 
                <br>He also has his own and cherishes it greatly, to the point where he keeps it on his desk by his bedside and even talks to it.

            <p class="p1">HINA-DOLLS are a Girl's Festival (March 3) decoration. 
                <br>In Japan, they are called "HINA-NINGYOU" or "OHINA-SAMA". 
                <br>For the first time, these displays are decorated on the first girl's day after a baby girl was born for her. 
                <br>Then, the displays are decorated for a month every year. Some customers sometimes asked me, 
                <br>how long does it decorate, how old she would be. 
                <br>I would answer that she can decide it by herself because the displays are her own things. 
                <br>Hina dolls are displayed to pray for her good health and good fortunes.
